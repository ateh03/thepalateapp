        <h2>About</h2>
        <h4>Palate is a native iOS / Android app written with React Native and Node.js using Firebase as a database for cloud and API data.</h4>
        <h4>This project was created as part of the <a href="https://capstone.cse.sc.edu/">University of South Carolina's CSCE Capstone</a> for Spring 2024</h4>
        <h3>Privacy & Protection</h3>
        <p>Palate’s data collection process is meticulous in ensuring that no critical Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is collected within our database. The account making process extends the Google and Apple ID API, which does not store users’ password in the conventional format in our database. Instead, users login with their respective Apple or Google login, and our platform receives the encrypted password, but does not store it.</p>
        <p>Users must agree to provide Palate with their full name and email address to use the application, for integrity purposes. In the event of a data breach, very little insightful information will be available to threat actors.</p>

        <h3>On User Equality</h3>
        <p>Palate was developed by a diverse team of project developers and managers. We are careful in equal representation and mitigating bias across race, gender and religion. Frequency distribution and equal accessibility across demographics has been at the forefront since the project’s conception, and we are careful in how we manage our biases.</p>
        <p>A large part of the world of cooking is its roots in culture and geodemographic. Palate celebrates diversity and seeks to serve as a platform for inclusivity, connecting users with different food archetypes from a variety of sources.</p>
        <p>Our inclusive selection includes…</p>

        <ol>Recipes from 80+ countries around the world</ol>
        <ol>Recipes for religious or dietary restrictions (vegan, kosher, halal, etc.)</ol>
        <ol>Recipe database expansion, where we continuously expand with new recipes each update.</ol>
